# Scripts

These are my own personal scripts I use daily.

They could be done way better and more securely, so use at your own risk!

## Explanation

Here is a brief explanation of what my scripts do:
* skill   - will give a dmenu prompt to kill a process
* off     - will give a dmenu prompt to kill bspwm, shutdown or run slock
* pics    - will open images with imv
* picdir  - will open image directories with imv
* vids    - will open videos with mpv
* scripts - will give a dmenu prompt of these scripts
* unarch  - will extract from a number of archive formats
* audio   - will give a dmenu prompt, where audio level can be input

## License

These scripts are all under the GPL V3 license.
